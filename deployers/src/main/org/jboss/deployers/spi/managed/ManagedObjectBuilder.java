/**
 * ManagedObjectBuilder.
 * 
 * TODO Critique
 *      Rather having the contexts create the managed objects directly
 *      they should provide the underlying metadata, e.g. the Fields + other information
 *      from which we can create the managed object.
 *      This is important because it is likely that multiple builders/deployers will
 *      play populate an object, e.g. (possibly?)
 *      - the parsing deployer will describe the properties/metadata
 *      - there maybe transformation, augmentation by some other deployers
 *      - the component deployers will want to link their component metadata back into
 *            the parent by reference, e.g. an mbean as part of sar/-service.xml  
 *      - the real deployer will describe any runtime support, e.g. managed operations and statistics
