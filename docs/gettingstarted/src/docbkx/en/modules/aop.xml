   <title>AOP Configuration and Usage</title>

   <para>When writting new version of Kernel, there was always a need for
      simple usage of advanced AOP features in the Kernel itself.
      With the version 2.0.0 of Microcontainer there is an elegant way of
      binding your aspect to wired POJOs, using all the advantages of full
      dependency state machine. Meaning that even aspect behave as installed
      services, having full lifecycle and dependency support in the Microcontainer.
      And it's all a matter of configuration if you want to use aspectized Microcontainer
      or just plain POJO behaviour.
