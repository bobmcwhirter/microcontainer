  <title>Introduction to the JBoss Microcontainer</title>

  <para>The JBoss Microcontainer (MC) provides an environment to configure and
  manage POJOs (plain old java objects). It is designed to reproduce the
  existing JBoss JMX Microkernel but targetted at POJO environments. As such
  it can be used standalone outside the JBoss Application Server.</para>

  <para>The 2.0.x release provides a set of features to support POJO
  deployment in JBossAS-5.0.x, JBossESB, and the bootstrap of services used by
  standalone projects like embedded EJB3.</para>

  <para>This document takes you through the design of the microcontainer
  including design decisions and future directions.

      <title>JBoss Microcontainer Highlights</title>
      <para>The primary focus of the MC is as a framework for
      building server kernels. It replaces the legacy JMX based kernel
      found in JBossAS4.x and earlier with a POJO based kernel that
      has been generalized to better support extensibility along the
      primary aspects required for a server type of environment: aop, metadata,
      class loading, deployments, state management, lifecycle/dependcies, configuration,
      and management. The use of the term server should not be correlated with
      large memory/cpu requirment environments of typical application/web servers.
      A server in the context of the MC is just a kernel for plugging POJO
      container models into. The MC can be configured for extremely lightweight
      application type setups like a junit testcase as well as full feature
      application servers.
